## Platform Engineer (DevOps)

I build and operate enterprise-grade cloud platforms that enable AI systems and Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), with 3+ years of hands-on experience across Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Terraform and CI/CD automation.

### ✍️ Contributions
#### [Horizon-SDV](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv)
Primary contributions focused on enabling secure, production-ready GenAI workflows and developer tooling within the Horizon-SDV platform.
- **Release 3.0.0**
  - [TAA-511 | Gemini Code Assist in R3 – MCP Gateway Registry and Gerrit MCP Server integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv/blob/main/docs/release-notes-3-0-0.md#taa-511--gemini-code-assist-in-r3--gerrit-mcp-server-integration)
    - Enabled centralised management and authentication of MCP servers and agents via [MCP Gateway Registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry) deployment into Horizon.
    - Enabled secure LLM-assisted code review workflows for AI tools like Gemini via [Gerrit-MCP server](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit-mcp-server/) context access.
    - Reduced manual setup for AI-assisted development by implementing a cross-platform Python-based CLI tool (`gemini-mcp-setup`) to automate MCP server authentication (token management) and configuration for Gemini.
  - [TAA-377 | Google AOSP Repo Mirroring](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv/blob/main/docs/release-notes-3-0-0.md#taa-377--google-aosp-repo-mirroring)
    - Reduced AAOS build times by **60%** by introducing an on-demand, high performance Git mirror solution using GCP Filestore (NFS). Automated the full sync lifecycle via Jenkins and Terraform.
- **Release 2.0.0**
  - [TAA-9 | Cloud Workstation integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv/blob/main/docs/extended-release-notes/release-notes-2-0-0.md#taa-9--cloud-workstation-integration)
    - Integrated Google Cloud Workstations into Horizon-SDV. Built a Jenkins CD suite using Terraform and Bash to provision secure, browser-based IDEs with 4-tier RBAC.

### 💻 Personal Projects
#### [AOSP Mirror Git Server](https://github.com/akshaykaura20/aosp-mirror-git-server)
- A high-performance Apache-based Git server, for hosting AOSP Git mirror on GCP, accelerating repo sync in AAOS builds by at least 50%. Used in the Horizon Hackathon at Google Cloud Space Munich.
